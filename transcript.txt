This is the video you've been waiting for. The number one question I've gotten over the last few weeks since OpenClaw released is, "Okay, I get the technology is powerful, but how does this actually make my life better?" In this video, I'm going to answer that question. I'm going to go through six lifechanging open claw use cases that I personally guarantee will be applicable to everyone watching this video. I don't care if you've never touched a computer in your life or you're a complete technical wizard, you're going to find at least one workflow in this video that will convince you that Open Claw is the most powerful technology of all time. Now, let's lock in and get into it. The first use case I want to go through is a second brain. Have you ever been on the road and you came up with an idea or found a link you wanted to remember or a book you wanted to read, but you didn't have a system for saving any of that? and maybe you're using something like notion or Apple notes. But the issue is both those tools can get very complex, especially when you start putting a lot of information into it. I built a second brain system with Open Claw that helps me remember everything I think of all with just a simple text message. Openclaw has the best memory system of any AI tool ever created. It remembers literally everything you tell it. So, you need to take advantage of this memory system. So, I built this second brain system you see here, which allows me to view and search through every conversation we've ever had. This is amazing because now at any time, I can go into Telegram or iMessage or Discord or wherever I'm communicating with my bot and just send it things to remember. So, maybe you're on the road and your friend tells you about a book you want to read. What you were probably doing before is maybe you'd go into notion, you go into this really complex folder system, or maybe go into Apple Notes, which has 10,000 notes in it that you'll never read ever again. With OpenClaw, I can simply just text message anything to my bot Henry, say, "Hey, please remember this for me," and then come back into my second brain system at any point and find those memories very easily. So, for instance, if I'm on the road and I find a book about local LLM, I can say, "Remind me to read a book about local LLMs." I can hit enter. That text Henry to remember whatever that is I was talking about. And what's amazing is you can do this literally from iMessage and send that there. And then in my second brain system that I built here that I'll show you how to build yourself in a second with OpenClaw. I can now go in and either search through my memories. If I hit command K, I have this global search. And now I can say local LLMs. And now I have every single memory and document and task I've ever given Henry and can find it very very easily and pop it open and read it here. This is the most powerful second brain system in the world. One, because it remembers literally everything. And two, I don't need to use annoying complex apps like notion. I can just text my Open Claw from my phone and it remembers everything I text it. That's again the most amazing part about Open Claws. The interface is so simple. You don't need apps. You don't need anything that you just text message your bot. Now, you want to build this yourself. Very simple. I got good news for you. Your open claw is super intelligent. It can do anything you ask it. I'll put this prompt down below, so feel free to copy and paste it into your own open claw. But what you want to say is, I want to build a second brain system where I can review all our notes, conversations, and memories. Please build that out with Nex.js. You hit enter on that, and your open claw will literally just build out this entire system for you. It does the vibe coding for you. You're not even vibe coding anymore. Your bots's doing the vibe coding. I didn't touch a line of code to build what you saw here. I just told my OpenClaw to build it, and it went and built it for me. Everyone needs a second brain system. So, if you haven't yet, go to your OpenClaw, text it, say, "Hey, build this for me." You can text it from the road and it'll build it on your computer, and you will have your second brain system all set up and good to go. The second use case that I'll go through that I promise will make your life so much easier is the custom morning brief. Every morning at 8:00 a.m., my bot Henry sends me a completely custom morning brief with everything I need to know going into that day. This is scheduled. I don't need to think about it, and includes all the important information I need to know. So, for instance, it tells me the biggest AI stories from the last night, so that when I wake up, I instantly know everything I need to know from the news. It gives me a bunch of video ideas. So, you can see here, I have three ideas for new videos I can film. And what you don't see here is it actually wrote the entire scripts for these videos, too. So, I can just wake up and I have scripts ready for me, good to go. It takes a look at my to-do list on my Mac and tells me any tasks I need to complete that morning. And then it recommends me tasks it can do itself to help me out. This ensures the moment I wake up, I have all the information I need. And also, I already have work done. I'm literally up for one minute and I already have multiple scripts written out, good to go. I've used several of these scripts over the last couple weeks, and I bet you didn't even realize it was built by my bot, Henry. This morning brief alone has saved me several hours a week. And the best part is is you can customize this any way you want with one simple message. And the reason you can do this and the reason why this is so powerful is is a few things. Open Claw has complete access to the internet. So while I'm sleeping, it literally opens up a browser, just sits there and researches on the internet all night long. And then two, it does task proactively. So it will schedule this and send me these morning briefs at the same time every morning. And even better, on top of all that, it goes directly to my phone. So this is all texted to me through Telegram. So I don't need to go in these confusing third party apps to find these morning briefs. They're all texted directly to me in the apps I use daily and I get all the information I need and tasks done the moment I wake up. So, how do you set this up yourself? Very simple. Go to your open claw and type this in. I want to set up a regular morning brief. Every morning, I want you to send me a report through Telegram. I want this report to include one new stories relevant to my interest, two ideas for businesses I can create, three tasks I need to complete today, and four recommendations for tasks we can complete together today. And you can customize this any way you want. Literally anything you want in your morning brief, you just put it into this message. The reason why I really like number four is it actually has the AI come up with its own tasks that it can help you with. So, it thinks of things on its own that you maybe you didn't know it could do, but you hit enter on this and it will go and it just will schedule and do this for you. No technical work needed. And after just 5 seconds, you now have a morning brief coming in every morning with all the important information you need to know and a brief on what you need to do that day. It doesn't matter what industry you're in or what you do. You can create a custom morning brief that will be helpful for your life and save you time. And if you can't think of what you want in that morning brief, I have even better news for you. You don't even have to think of things to put in your brief. You can just say, "I want this report to include things relevant to me." You can just say, "Hey, think of things to put in this report." So, you don't even need to creatively think about it. You can just lean on your open claw to think of what to put in that report. Easy peasy prompt down below. Steal it. Put it in. You instantly have more value in your life. The third thing I built with my open claw that has changed my life that I think will change a lot of other people's lives is really relevant if you're into content creation. Whether you tweet or you create YouTube videos or you write newsletters or you do literally anything to do with content, I think this one's relevant to you. And if you have absolutely no interest in content, you don't write any content, feel free to skip to the next chapter. But I built my own content factory. I use Discord for this because Discord is great for channels. So, I'd highly recommend going in and setting up your OpenClaw in Discord if you don't know how to literally just go to your Open Claw and say, "Hey, set up a Discord for us." And what I have my Open Claw do is a few things every morning. One, it researches the top content opportunities that day. So, it'll go research the top stories. It'll research content trending from my competitors. It'll research things performing well on social media. And then, it'll come up with those ideas for content. Then Henry takes this research and passes it off to another agent, Quill, who then takes this and actually writes scripts. So it takes one of the ideas that Quill thinks is the best, and then writes an entire script for that idea. And this doesn't have to just be scripts, it could be tweets if you want, it could be newsletters if you want, whatever you want. Then from there, the scripts are passed off to another sub agent, Pixel, who then goes and actually generates AI thumbnails for the videos. So, what you can see here is actually a local AI model that's running on my Mac Studio that generates images. You can use Nano Banana for this. You don't need to use a local model. I just like to use a local model. I'm still training this local model now to make good thumbnails, but very soon I will have very good AI thumbnails printing out. The point being is you can set up these complex systems inside Discords where you have multiple agents in different channels basically running a content factory for you. Here's the prompt you're going to use to set it up. I put this down below as well. Feel free to put it into your Telegram or Discord or whatever communication your channel you're using with your Open Claw. I want you to build me a content factory inside of Discord. Set up channels for different agents. Have an agent that researches top trending stories, another agent that takes those stories and writes scripts, then another agent that generates thumbnails. Have all their work organized in different channels. Your OpenClaw will go and set this all up for you. You don't need technical knowledge. It will just set it up, set up the different agents, and have them working. Then from there, you can ask it to do it regularly. I have this happen at 8 a.m. every morning. 8 a.m. every morning, each agent does that work. So, they'll do the research and then it'll generate scripts, then it'll generate thumbnails. You can customize this any way you want. If you're more focused on X, you can say, "Generate me threads, generate me posts." If you're more focused on newsletters, you can just say, "Hey, write me newsletters instead." This is completely custom. That's the beautiful part about all of this. So, take that prompt, build your own content factory. The next use case I want to go over is great for anyone who either a wants to build their own business or b needs to do research for their own business. They already have. There is this incredible skill from Matt Van Horde called the last 30 days skill. What this skill does is allow OpenClaw to research any topic you can think of and see what people are saying about it on Reddit and X. So for instance, say you're a wannabe entrepreneur. You want to start your own business. You want OpenClaw to build an app for you, but you don't know what to build an app about. You install this skill, which I'll show you how to do in a second. Then you go into your open claw and you say something like, "Please use the last 30-day skill to research challenges people are having with OpenClaw." And for you, you can put in any topic or subject you want in there. Then your OpenClaw will go in and actually research both X and Reddit over the last 30 days and find all the challenges with OpenClaw, right? And so if I'm thinking about this from an entrepreneurial perspective, I'm thinking, okay, what challenges are people having here? Since I am a major voice in OpenClaw, I could potentially build a product that solves one of these challenges. So, okay. So, looks like people are having setup difficulty now. Maybe I go and build a system where it makes it much easier to set up the open claw. Right? This is how entrepreneurs think. They look for challenges and then build solutions to those challenges. Now, taking this a step further, I can go in and I can ask my open claw, hey, build a product that solves this challenge. And now my open claw will go and vibe code a solution to any of these challenges. Then I ship it and I'm good to go. I got a product going. This is basically a software factory that I built. I didn't have to code. I didn't have to do any technical work. I just set up these skills and now my open claw is doing all this work for me. Anyone can do this. There's no special skill I have that allowed me to do what I just showed you. You whether you have a nineto-ive kids, I don't care. You can install this skill and literally within 15 seconds have a system set up where you are building products that you can sell and start making money off of. There is no hyperbole here. If you think I'm lying about any part of this, tell me which part of this I'm talking about that isn't true. I will have the link to this last 30 days skill down below. You simply copy and paste it into your open claw and say install this skill and boom, you have the skill and you're good to go. If you found any of this helpful so far, make sure to leave a like down below. Make sure to subscribe and turn on notifications. All I do is create incredible videos about AI and OpenClaw. Let me know down below which of these use cases have been the most helpful so far. I still have two more to go before we get to these last two. Just let me know which have been the most helpful before. And if you have any questions for me, feel free to join the Vibe Coding Academy. I'm doing a live boot camp this Friday. It will be recorded. You can be a part of it. You can ask me questions, anything you want. It's all part of the open claw boot camp that will be in the Vibe Coding Academy link down below. Join us for that. The next use case that I promise will help every single person watching this video, no matter how skeptical you are about OpenClaw is giving OpenClaw tasks that move you closer to your goals. Now, what does that mean? Open Claw can do anything a human being can do on a computer. The challenge most people have with OpenClaw is you got all this power in the world, but they can't think of what to do with it. So, what I built here that I'm about to show you is a system for OpenClaw to figure out tasks it can do on its own that gets you closer to your goals. So, I built out right here this canban board. By the way, every time I say canban, I get a 100 comments and say, "Oh, you're pronouncing it wrong." I don't care. I'm going to say canban. What happens is every morning, Henry, my openclaw, puts in its own tasks and starts getting to work on those tasks. These tasks always get me closer to what my overall goals are in my career. Right? So, right now it's researching ExoLabs, which is technology allows me to run local models on my Mac Studio, but you can see a lot of the other tasks it's done over the last day. It's edited my mission control here. By the way, if you want instructions on how to build your own mission control UI, let me know in the comments down below as well. It's researching ExoLabs. It's building a new council functionality that allow me to talk to a bunch of models at the same time. And this is all doing things that help me get closer to my goals. But how does it know what my goals are and how does it figure out what it should do? What I'm about to show you is the most important workflow you can do in Open Claw today, which is this. Brain dump into Open Claw every goal, mission, objective you have in your life, your personal life, and your career. This gives context to Open Claw around everything you're trying to accomplish. Right? So for me, I'm trying to grow my YouTube. I'm trying to grow my educational community. I'm trying to build incredible products. I'm trying to scale my SAS creator buddy. And I brain dumped all that into my OpenClaw. Now that OpenClaw knows all my missions and objectives in my life, I can give it a prompt that says, "Hey, every morning at 8:00 a.m., come up with four to five tasks that you can do on my computer that brings me closer to these goals." Now, OpenClaw every morning goes in, comes up with its own tasks, schedules them for itself, and completes those tasks. doing research for me, building scripts for me, writing content for me, building new functionality in my mission control for me. All these little things get me closer to my end goals. You should do this as well. So, two steps you need to do right now. Go into Telegram or however you're communicating with your open claw. Brain dump all your goals and then say, "Hey, every morning come up with tasks you can complete that get me closer to these goals." And then if you want to take it a step further like me, you can say, "Hey, build out a canban board that tracks these tasks so you can see every single thing your bot is doing." This system will basically turn your bot into a close employee that works for you that you can track. You need to do this. The only people that shouldn't be doing what I just recommended are people with no goals or ambitions in your life. And if you have no goals and ambitions in your life, why the hell are you watching this channel? Get the hell out of here. This channel's for high ambition people only. And the last use case I'll give you, the sixth out of six use case I'll give you is build your own mission control. What you see here, why should you build your own mission control? My goal with my mission control app here is I want to replace every piece of software I use. Notion, to-d doist, it doesn't matter what app I use. I want to replace it and build it myself with my openclaw. And the reason why I want to do that is Open Claw has access to every memory, everything you've ever told it. By building out your own apps, by building your own calendar tools and note-taking tools and all of that, you now have tools that are directly integrated with every memory and conversation you've ever had with AI, which is incredibly powerful. And it doesn't even account for the fact that now I don't have to pay for these other tools. I'm just building them myself. So, as long as you're using computers and you have apps on your computer, this use case is impactful for you. You're basically just having your OpenClaw build out all the apps you're already using. And this isn't complicated. You just go to your OpenClaw and you say, "Hey, I'm tired of using Google Calendar. Please build out our own version using NextJS." And you hit enter and it'll just build you the app and it'll ship it and launch it and run it. and you just go to the URL it gives you and you have your own calendar app and you don't need to use Google calendar anymore as long as you use software which I assume if you're watching this channel and watching like a 20 minute long openclaw video you probably have apps you use this use case impacts you it saves you money and it supercharges your apps because it plugs it into all your openclaw memories right this is my calendar this isn't just showing the events on my calendar this is showing the automated tasks my openclaw does every day. So, that makes it a way more powerful calendar. Now, the last thing I'll go through on this video that I think is really important is cost. The I think the number one reply I get in all my videos is, "Yeah, but talk about cost. How much is this costing you? Are you broke now?" No, this is only costing me $200 a month. That's how much the anthropic subscription costs. But you don't need to do this for $200 a month. You can do this for way cheaper. Miniax just released a model called Miniax 2.5. It is incredibly powerful. It is basically as powerful as Opus and it is about $10 a month. You don't need to use Opus. You can say, "Hey, use Miniax instead and you'll save money." There's a model called GLM5 that you can use. That's another $5 a month. There are expensive ways to do this like Opus and there are cheap ways to do this like Miniax. So depending on what your budget is, you have many different options. It's totally up to you. I personally am going with Anthropic because I think it's the best coding model in the world, but you can go with cheaper options. Let me know down below which is going to be the first use case you implement. And also more importantly, let me know down below what video do you want to see next about OpenClaw. Is there any specific use case? Is there anything you want me to show you how to set up? Let me know down below. I'm happy to go through. I'm thinking about doing a video around how to plug in local models to open claw so you can save money with open models. Let me know down below if that's what you want to see as well.
